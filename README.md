A telegram controlled database for various items.


## Current version

I have a telegram bot running on second computer that fetches for articles, free things (on sites that lists them),mcDonalds coupons (hate me or love me, but they are tasty) and two checks (one for temperature for my strawberries and one to see if there is some issue with my water)

There are more features planned but this is current version.

If you want to use it, create api.py file with following code
api = "TELEGRAM API"
cid ="CHAT ID"
discord = "Discord webhook (for nástěnka bot - irrelevant if you are not on the same school as I am"
driver = location of your chromedriver (look more into it here https://chromedriver.chromium.org)
